# Beecrowd `Beginner` *Average 1* Challenge! :arrow_heading_down:

### *Description:*

Read two floating points' values of double precision A and B, corresponding to two student's grades. After this, calculate the student's average, considering that grade A has weight 3.5 and B has weight 7.5. Each grade can be from zero to ten, always with one digit after the decimal point. Don’t forget to print the end of line after the result, otherwise you will receive “Presentation Error”. Don’t forget the space before and after the equal sign.


### *Input:*

The input file contains 2 floating points' values with one digit after the decimal point.

### *Output:*

Print the message "MEDIA" and the student's average according to the following example, with 5 digits after the decimal point and with a blank space before and after the equal signal.

|  Input Samples |  Output Samples |
|---|---|
|`5.0` `7.1` | *MEDIA = 6.43182*
|`0.0` `7.1` | *MEDIA = 4.84091*
|`10.0` `10.0` | *MEDIA = 10.00000*

# Beecrowd `Beginner` *Average 2* Challenge! :arrow_heading_down:

### *Description:*

Read three values (variables A, B and C), which are the three student's grades. Then, calculate the average, considering that grade A has weight 2, grade B has weight 3 and the grade C has weight 5. Consider that each grade can go from 0 to 10.0, always with one decimal place.


### *Input:*

The input file contains 3 values of floating points (double) with one digit after the decimal point.

### *Output:*

Print the message "MEDIA" and the student's average according to the following example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal.

|  Input Samples |  Output Samples |
|---|---|
|`5.0` `6.0` `7.0` | *MEDIA = 6.43182*
|`5.0` `10.0` `10.0` | *MEDIA = 4.84091*
|`10.0` `10.0` `5.0` | *MEDIA = 10.00000*
