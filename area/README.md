# Beecrowd `Beginner` Challenge! :arrow_heading_down:

### *Description*

Make a program that reads three floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show: <br/>
a) the area of the rectangled triangle that has base A and height C. <br/>
b) the area of the radius's circle C. (pi = 3.14159) <br/>
c) the area of the trapezium which has A and B by base, and C by height. <br/>
d) the area of the square that has side B. <br/>
e) the area of the rectangle that has sides A and B. <br/>


### *Input*

The input file contains three double values with one digit after the decimal point.

### *Output*

The output file must contain 5 lines of data. Each line corresponds to one of the areas described above, always with a corresponding message (in Portuguese) and one space between the two points and the value. The value calculated must be presented with 3 digits after the decimal point.
